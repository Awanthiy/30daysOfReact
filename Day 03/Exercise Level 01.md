What is a module?

* In React, a module is a reusable unit of code that encapsulates functionality and data. It allows you to organize your code into smaller, 
well-defined pieces, promoting code maintainability, reusability, and separation of concerns. Here's a breakdown of key concepts:

What is package?

*
In React, a package is a collection of reusable code, resources, and
metadata (information about the package) bundled together for distribution and sharing.
It's distinct from a module, which is a specific unit of code within a package.

What is the difference between a module and a package.

*Module:

In React, a module can still refer to a single .js file containing your application's components, functions, or utility code. These modules typically house reusable bits of functionality specific to your React project.
You'll often create custom modules to group related React components or logic together for better organization within your project.
React itself doesn't enforce a specific structure for modules, but it's common practice to follow a modular approach for better code maintainability.
Package:

In React development, the term "package" is more commonly used. React itself is a reusable library distributed as a package. You install it using npm install react or yarn add react. This package contains multiple modules (JavaScript files) that provide the core functionalities of React (like ReactDOM, useState, etc.).
You can also install other third-party React component libraries or utility libraries as packages. These packages often include their own set of internal modules that provide the specific functionality offered by the library.

What is NPM?

*Node Package Manager

What is Webpack?

*Webpack is a popular JavaScript module bundler. In the context of React, it plays a vital role in taking your project's code and preparing it for efficient browser execution.


How do you create a new React project?

*Install Create React App globally: If you haven't already, install Create React App globally using npm or yarn:

Bash
npm install -g create-react-app
Use code with caution.
Create a new project: Navigate to your terminal and run the following command, replacing my-app with your desired project name:

Bash
npx create-react-app my-app
Use code with caution.
This command will create a new directory named my-app with the essential React project structure and dependencies pre-configured.

What are the files and folders inside a project folder(package.json, package-lock.json or yarn.lock, .gitignore,node_modules and public)?

*package.json,
*package-lock.json or yarn.lock


What is your favorite code editor (I believe that it is Visual Studio Code)?


*yes it is.
Add different Visual Studio Code extensions to improve your productivity(eg. prettier, ESLint etc).
Try to make a different custom module in a different file and import it to index.js.
