Reasons for choosing React:

  React is one of the most popular front-end libraries in the world,
  with a large and active community. This means there are extensive resources,
  libraries, and tools available to support development and troubleshoot issues.
 
used to gauge it:

Github stars and forks: React has significantly more stars and forks on Github compared to Vue.
Stack Overflow surveys: React consistently ranks higher than Vue in terms of developer satisfaction and interest in using it again.
Job postings: There are generally more job postings seeking React developers compared to Vue developers.
Website traffic: Websites built with React seem to have higher overall traffic according to web analytics tools.
However, popularity isn't everything:

It's important to choose the right tool for the job based on your specific 
needs and circumstances. Both React and Vue are excellent frameworks with their own strengths and weaknesses. 
For example, Vue might be easier to learn for beginners while React offers more mature tooling and ecosystem support.
